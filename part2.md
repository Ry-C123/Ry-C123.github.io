#### Part2: Injecting Fake Explosions

One of the biggest problems in transient astronmy, when building methadology, is that true transients are very uncommon. So much so, that it is impossible to reliably test any transient identification method using raw data. Therefore, to test the reliabilty of image subtraction we must inject fake transients into our data. Below shows the result of this process.
