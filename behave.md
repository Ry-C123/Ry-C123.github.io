# Behaivoural Study for Digital Education

The focus of this study was to determine what would attract users to better learn or buy a product. This involved collaboration across the whole company, design, marketing, and product insights. 

The approach we took focussed on the [COM-B model for behaivoural change](https://thedecisionlab.com/reference-guide/organizational-behavior/the-com-b-model-for-behavior-change). 

The three letters of COM:

1. **Capability:** This refers to the individual's psychological and physical ability to engage in a particular behavior. It includes both the individual's physical capacity (skills and knowledge) and psychological capacity (mental and emotional factors) to perform the behavior.

2. **Opportunity:** This refers to the external factors that influence behavior, including the physical and social environment. It includes factors like access to resources, social norms, and physical context that can either facilitate or hinder behavior.

3. **Motivation:** This refers to the individual's internal and external drives to engage in a behavior. Motivation is divided into three sub-components:
   * Automatic motivation: Refers to subconscious processes that drive behavior without conscious intention, like habits.
   * Reflective motivation: Involves conscious decision-making and goal setting based on beliefs, values, and desires.
   * Emotional motivation: Includes emotional responses and desires that can influence behavior.

We quickly realised that all three factors would be drastically different from person to person. To solve for this, we created a multitude of personas based on survey data from product insights and marketing. 
Using sentiment analysis, I was able to pull out 5 repeating themes from survey results:

1. **Hair Health:** this is one of the more common themes. Many customers are concerend with keeping their hair in good condition.
2. **Social Media:** A significant portion of our customer base want to show off their looks.
3. **Ease of Life:** Styling hair is often part of the daily routine, making the process faster/easier/cheaper can be what makes a product stand out.
4. **Personalisation:** Customers are more receptive when products feel like they were *made* for them.
5. **Education:** One of the biggest blockers is users confidence when using a product.

Next I grouped surveys by sentiment to find prevailing persona types. In total there were 7 types of persona:
1. **The beginner:** These are new users or people thinking to buy their first styler. Often younger, these people are willing to engage with digital content to learn and improve.
2. **Infrequent User:** These users style for occasion (i.e., less than once a month). Usually less confident when styling, willing to engage with digital content to learn and improve.
3. **The Veteran:** Frequently style, these users have developed habits already. Less inclined to take new information, but is looking for ways to make styling easier. 
4. **The Bargain Hunter:** Styles hair regularly, is less interested in social motivators or hair health, wants styled hair at budget/quickly. 
5. **The Show-off:** Wants the best gadgets on the market. Less interested in performance, cares about luxury and prestige.
6. **The Wannabe Influencer:** Wants a product that they can use to look good on camera. This can be for cosmetic tutorials or just a good insta pic. Will engage with digital content, but not necessarily to learn/ 
7. **The Explorer:** Wants to try new styles without dire reprocussions. Likes trying new products to see how they work. Will engage with digital content.

1 and 2, and 5 and 6 had significant overlap in capbility, motivators and oppurtunity; so, I decided to consider each pair as one. Leaving 5 distinct personas.
