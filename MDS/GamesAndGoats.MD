# Games and Goats

One thing I liked about outreach is that I could often demonstrate the intersection of different subjects. In this case, maths and coding! Mathematical modelling is one of those topics that can be difficult to demonstrate in an engaging way as the barrier to entry is steep. Here are a few demonstrations I used to do :

## Monty Hall +
$$
Strategy =
\\begin{cases}
\\text{Switch} & \\quad \\text{when $N_c/N_d < 0.5$}\\\\
\\text{Coin Toss} & \\quad \\text{when $N_c/N_d = 0.5$}\\\\
\\text{Stick} & \\quad \\text{when $N_c/N_d > 0.5$}
\\end{cases}
$$

## Greedy Piggies

## SIRD Modelling
