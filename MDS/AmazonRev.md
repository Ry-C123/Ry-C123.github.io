## Amazon Review Webscraper

One of the first challenges I was given working in [current company] was to quickly determine sentiment of amazon purchases. 
I started by building a generalised web scraper (All the generalised code at the bottom of the page ðŸ˜‰) and using that too mine the data.

All the content of the review is captured; including date it was written, product rating, images, URL of the review, if the purchase is verrfied, and the product variant.
