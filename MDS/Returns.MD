After six months of working at [company], I was tasked with cleaning some returns data for a new product we had just released. Like any good data scientist I visualised all the available data and quickly spotted a problem with another product unrelated to the work I was tasked with. *Two of our products was seeing a massive maintained rised in returns*.
