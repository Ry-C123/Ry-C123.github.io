### Data Augmentation using Zernike Moments for realistic and extreeme PSFs


**Project Context:** My PhD centred on the rapid discovery of kilonovae. These are the explosions caused by colliding neutron stars. They last between 2-10 days in the visible spectrum, so locating them fast is crucial to understanding their physics. The challenge is that we are looking for them as a counterpart to gravitational waves, the LIGO-O3 sensativity meant this was usually the whole sky (see below).
